# CSS/HTML Social Media Profile
 practice using media queries(mobile first), lists, and tables

 Lab Assignment instructions:
 
 Build a social media profile page, this is a single page and does not need tons of content. This is only to test your understanding of the mobile-first and layout concepts.
DO NOT copy any existing social media page code but you can draw inspiration from them for your layout or design.
Must have a profile area
Must have an example list of at least 5 previous 'posts'
Must have a 'add post' form (does not have to actually post anywhere)
Must have more than one column on desktop
Design and style must change to a single column when on mobile devices using breakpoints
You may use a CSS framework for small components if you wish. DO NOT use the grid system from a css framework as this defeats the purpose of the exercise.
Use your own pictures or download them from google images.
